# IDEAS

This document contains a collection of brainstorming ideas for the Geministrator project.

## A2A Workflows

-   **Jules as a "rubber duck"**: The user can describe a problem to Jules, who then clarifies and helps the user think through the problem. Jules could then hand off the implementation to another agent.
-   **Automated testing and debugging**: Jules can write tests for a piece of code, and another agent can run them, analyze the results, and suggest fixes.
-   **Code review and refactoring**: One agent can write code, and another can review it for style, errors, and performance, then suggest or apply refactorings.
-   **Decomposition of large tasks**: The user provides a high-level goal, and one agent breaks it down into smaller, manageable tasks for other agents to work on.

## IDE Features

-   **Smarter Autocomplete**: Go beyond basic code completion by using an agent to predict the next few lines of code based on context.
-   **On-the-fly documentation**: An agent can automatically generate documentation for a function or class as the user is writing it.
-   **Intelligent search**: Instead of simple text search, the user can ask questions in natural language like "where is the user authentication logic?".
-   **Voice commands**: Allow the user to control the IDE with their voice, e.g., "run the tests", "commit my changes", "find all references to this function".

## Project and Language Management

-   **Project Templates**: Provide pre-configured project templates for different languages and frameworks.
-   **Dependency Management**: An agent can help manage project dependencies, suggesting libraries, checking for conflicts, and automating updates.
-   **Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration**: Integrate with LSPs for different languages to provide rich features like go-to-definition, find-references, and hover-information.
-   **Environment Configuration**: An agent can help the user set up their development environment, install necessary tools, and configure environment variables.

## GitHub Integration

-   **Natural Language Pull Requests**: The user can describe the changes they've made in plain English, and an agent will generate a well-formatted pull request with a title, description, and relevant labels.
-   **Automated code review on PRs**: An agent can automatically review pull requests, leaving comments and suggestions.
-   **Issue Management**: The user can create and manage GitHub issues from within the IDE using natural language.
-   **Automated release notes**: An agent can generate release notes based on the commit history since the last release.
